Mastermind Game 
Coding instructions:

Build a mastermind game that allows the user to play against the computer. The game can make use of any kind of interface; it could be a webpage, a command line program, an Android app - anything you like. You can also use any programming language/framework you want.


If you're not familiar with the game, you can find instructions for how to play Mastermind on https://bit.ly/2XuJISm. The basic premise is that the computer generates a row of four coloured pegs (the "code") which the user has to crack.


Depending on how much time you have and how you get on, here are some things you could do:

The computer could have a predetermined code (ie it would always be yellow-blue-green-red)

The computer could randomly choose which colours to use (ie in one game the code could be red-green-blue-yellow, and for the next it could be yellow-blue-green-red)

The computer could choose from a selection of four colours, or more

Each colour could be used only one time, or an unlimited amount of times (ie the code could be red-red-red-red)

Once the user has made a guess, you could check how correct the guess was and:

Indicate how many of the pegs are the right colour, and/or

Indicate how many of the pegs are the right colour and location, and/or

Specify which pegs are the right colour and location
